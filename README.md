# Quantitative comparison of fully convolutional neural networks for tissue segmentation on brain magnetic resonance imaging

## Requirements
### Folder structure
Once the repository has been clone/downloaded, there will be only the ```log``` and ```models``` folders and the iSeg2017.ipynb file. Add the folders ```datasets``` (folder containing the testing and training sets provided by the challenge organisers), ```results``` and ```refined-results```. The resulting tree should look as indicated below.
