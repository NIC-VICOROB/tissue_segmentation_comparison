## Requirements
### Libraries
The code has been tested with the following configuration

- h5py == 2.7.0
- ipython == 5.3.0
- jupyter == 1.0.0
- keras == 2.0.2
- nibabel == 2.1.0
- nipype == 0.12.1
- python == 2.7.12
- scipy == 0.19.0
- sckit-image == 0.13.0
- sckit-learn == 0.18.1
- tensorflow == 1.0.1
- tensorflow-gpu == 1.0.1

## How to run it
There are two main steps to run our framework. First, update parameters inside the configuration.py file. Make sure you update dataset_info inside general_configuration to your specific setup. Also, update fields on training_configuration to desired values. Approaches that can be tried are 'DolzMulti', 'Kamnitsas', 'Guerrero' and 'Cicek'. Second, run the following on command line

```
python main.py
```
